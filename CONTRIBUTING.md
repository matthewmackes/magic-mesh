# Contributing to MCNF

The operational rulebook is [`AI_GOVERNANCE.md`](AI_GOVERNANCE.md) — read its
locks (§1–§8) before changing anything load-bearing. The short version: the
substrate (Nebula / LizardFS / Bus / max-crypto) and the look (IBM Carbon,
single-sourced in `mde-theme`) are **locked**; new code is glue over the
existing crates, and a feature isn't done until it's runtime-reachable with
no stubs (§7).

## Build prerequisites

> **Canonical, full build environment + the build farm + every gotcha:**
> [`docs/BUILD-ENVIRONMENT.md`](docs/BUILD-ENVIRONMENT.md). This is the short version.

Fedora (the target platform + the build-farm VMs):

```bash
sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ cmake mold pkg-config \
  gtk3-devel alsa-lib-devel libxkbcommon-devel opus-devel protobuf-compiler
```

**EL9 / Rocky 9 (the actual dev host `172.20.145.192`) — two things bite:**
1. `opus-devel` is in **CRB**, not the default repos:
   `sudo dnf --enablerepo=crb install -y opus-devel`.
2. gcc 11.5 **rejects `mold`** (`.cargo/config.toml` selects it). Build with the
   gold linker: `RUSTFLAGS="-C link-arg=-fuse-ld=gold" cargo build --workspace`.
   (The farm VMs run gcc 15, so mold works there — no override.)

- Rust: MSRV **1.85** (the floor, CI-enforced); `rust-toolchain.toml` pins
  **1.94** as the dev ceiling (softbuffer 0.4.8 breaks on 1.95 — see the
  file header).
- The vendored Opus tree needs `CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5`;
  `.cargo/config.toml` sets it, CI sets it explicitly.
- All 22 crates are workspace members; nothing is excluded from the build.
- **Offload heavy/parallel builds to the farm:** `install-helpers/xcp-build.sh
  cargo …` (builds on `172.20.0.50`); status via `install-helpers/farm.sh status`.

## Test rules

```bash
cargo test --workspace --exclude mackesd          # parallel — everything else
cargo test -p mackesd --features async-services -- --test-threads=1
```

**mackesd MUST run serially.** Several of its tests mutate process-global env
(`std::env::set_var`) while siblings read it; in parallel the suite corrupts
`environ` and hangs (tracked: EFF-18). `--features async-services` is the
superset (compiles + runs the daemon-worker suites).

Carbon token / palette / metric changes additionally require
`cargo test -p mde-theme` — a token value changes only with a matching test
assertion (§4).

## Gates (all must pass before a commit lands)

```bash
cargo build --workspace --locked
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets     # crypto/unwrap lints are deny-level
cargo fmt --all -- --check
./install-helpers/lint-mesh-boundary.sh    # §6 — no mesh→desktop-shell dep
./install-helpers/lint-carbon-tokens.sh    # §4 — no raw colour outside mde-theme
./install-helpers/lint-motion.sh           # §4 — no bespoke animation duration outside mde-theme
./install-helpers/lint-bus-names.sh        # §2 — no private D-Bus names
cargo deny check                           # EFF-16 — advisories/licenses/bans/sources
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs all of the above on pinned 1.85, plus a
nightly `--include-ignored` job, a Fedora-native container job, a coverage
floor, and a CycloneDX SBOM artifact.

## Conventions that will bite you if skipped

- **No raw hex / scattered metric literals** outside
  `crates/shared/mde-theme` (§4). Use tokens; the lint gate catches colours,
  review catches metrics.
- **No new MDE-private D-Bus names** (§2). MDE-internal IPC rides `mde-bus`
  (`action/<prefix>/<verb>` → `reply/<ulid>`); only FDO `org.freedesktop.*`
  interop touches D-Bus.
- **Bus responders cap bodies** at `ipc::MAX_RPC_BODY_BYTES` before parsing —
  follow the existing `poll_once` patterns when adding a surface.
- **Worker shell-outs go through `workers::proc`** (kill-on-timeout); a bare
  `Command::output()` on a tick path pins a runtime thread when the child
  hangs (EFF-20).
- **libcosmic is pinned by rev** — all three consumers share one rev; bump
  all together (policy in the root `Cargo.toml` header, EFF-35).
- **Crypto floor** (§3): Ed25519 / AES-256-GCM / ChaCha20-Poly1305 / RSA-4096
  own keys / rustls. `cargo deny` bans openssl outright.

## Commits

Small, scoped, individually runtime-reachable + stub-free (§7). Why-not-what
messages. Pushing and releasing are operator-gated — don't push from
automation; the RPM cut is `/release` only.
